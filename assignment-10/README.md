1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
    A system font is a font that is already installed on your device, and may not be available on all devices. A web font is a font that is hosted on a server, so when designing a web page you don't have to worry if the user's device is compatible with your font. A web-safe font is a font that is the same as a system font but is know to already be installed on most devices, using this kind would help with load times.

2. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
    Having a font stack is important so that if you your desired font doesn't work on a user's device, you'll still have control of the design of your website, instead of the font just defaulting to Times New Roman.
