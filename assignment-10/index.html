<!--Fonts are another of those website elements you may not take note of until they're done poorly. Type is the oldest but most important inclusion in site design, and deserves careful consideration on styling. This is particularly important now that many surfers use multiple browsers, environments, and devices - all of which interact with fonts differently.
