A browsers interprets the data from the host server and displays the content. The info on how the page should be displayed is sent through the rendering engine which interprets the insctructions. The browser engine sends commands between you and the servers. I currently use chrome on my laptop and desktop, and I use safari on my ipad.

The markup lanuage basically is all the dialouge that will appear on a webpage, and how it is presented. HTML is the markup language we are using for this assignment and is very popular.
