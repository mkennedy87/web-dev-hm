I came across a login form and it was used to sign into facebook

Text input can input addresses, selection can be used to select gender and submit can be used to send all the information. All this could be on an application to a job.

I read through the assignment and then followed the assignment step by step. I hade to go back to the last chapter a few times for the address.
