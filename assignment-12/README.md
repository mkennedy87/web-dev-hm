Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
  They were very vague, they just said they needed a website. So I made it as generic as possible.

What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?
  Inline forces the elements to act like inline elements, Inline-Block respects margin and vertical spacing while also removes new lines inherent in the block elements, and Block can turn inline elements into block elements, the main use of this is for dropdown menus.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
  I read through the website, which was mostly review. Then I set up my website folder, and added all the meta and html elemnts since I just about have those memorized. I read through the assignment and picked out the stuff I knew how to do off the top of my head and did that first. Then I watched through several walkthrough videos, going back as far as assignment 6 for the forms. I saved and pushed often.
