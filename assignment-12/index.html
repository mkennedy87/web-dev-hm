<!--

The 4 main pages of almost all sites are the home, about, contact, and services (or blog, portfolio, gallery, etc) pages. Now that you have a broad understanding of what CSS can do for you, its time you start thinking in full sites and prototyping for potential clients. This site project, take the opportunity to use content generators to provide you with quick and accessible text and images, leaving you available to focus on site-wide styling and navigation.


IDEA!
For this assignment, create an imaginary client who needs a website for their business. Create a website mockup for this client, based on their color, content, and layout needs.

In this nav bar, create a dropdown menu with links to 3+ related outside sites.
Structure (or section) your pages with divs, considering classes and/or ids.
In the index.html, about.html, and services.html, use placeholder text to quickly add content to the site.
In the contact.html, create a form element with at least 3 input elements and a submit button.
Include at least 3 image elements with placeholder images.
In your style.css, utilize positioning properties on your elements to create layout.
Utilize color properties on your elements.
Utilize 2 complimentary fonts, including a fallback for each font.
Add pseduo-classes to your nav bar to make it interactive.
