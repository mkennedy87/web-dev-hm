I went and checked out Kotaku.com at waybackmachine. I went all the way back to December 10th 2004, and it looks weird. It looks like how I remember 90's websites. I didn't realize that this look carried this far into the 2000's, though, now that I think about it, it kind has a Myspace feeling as well. The format hasn't changed too much, it looks like each link to an artical is also paired with an excessive amount of links though. The links to affiliated sites are missing from the top of the page, also the color scheme is different, but I might actually remember the logo looking like that.

I actually had the git module already from Creative Coding I. I kept it after the class because I knew it was going to be used again. I did have problems getting changes to show up though, and just as I'm typing this, I'm realizing it was because I hadn't put a file in the folder. So my frustration was definitely my fault.
