# Assignment 2

## Mike Kennedy

I signed up for this class because I've actually wanted to learn how to make webpages for awhile. One of the reasons being that I'd like to design myself a webpage for my various art projects.

Three things I've learned/wish to learn are:
1. How to link images to a markup webpage
2. How to add a repository that is on my harddrive
3. How to make lists

[Kotaku](kotaku.com) is a website I visit daily.
