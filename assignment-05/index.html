      <h1>TOAST!!!!</h1>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <Ul>
            <li>Two pieces of bread</li>
            <li>Two tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>Optional: Blob's of jelly</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Take the two pieces of bread and slap those , <abbr title="dos pieces of bread">bad boys</abbr> into the toaster. I like to set the dial to just under 4. It needs to be hot enough to melt the butter like those nazi's at the end of Indiana Jones, but not so hot that the bread looks like it was hanging out at Pompeii when the bad times happened.</li>
          <li>After the toaster can't stand the bread anymore, it's time to spread that butter. You can use anything you want to do the spreadin', I usually just rub the toasted bread on a stick of butter.</li>
          <li>Consume before something else does.</li>
        </ol>
