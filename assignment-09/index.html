<!--
Color is an unforgettable inclusion on any visual project, particular when utilized poorly. With websites, we primarily dictate color properties using the CSS language and stylesheets files. This topic, you'll create a page dedicated to the color trends of a decade, and with this page, you can be as tacky, ugly, or kitsch as you want!

For this assignment, select a decade (ie, 1950s, 1980s, etc) and research the design trends of that period. You will need 3 related colors and 3 related illustrations or graphics. You may source any materials with citation.

*In the index.html, add the 4 main document elements and 4 meta elements.
*Inside the head element, add a link element. Create a style.css and link to it here using a relative URL.
Structure your page with divs, utilizing classes and/or ids (useful as selector types in your CSS).
Include at least 2 full image elements.
Include some text on your page.
In the style.css, use 2 different selector types.
Set the background property of an element.
Set the size of an element
Set the opacity of an element.
Set the position of an element.
Set the color of the text.
Anywhere in your stylesheet, add a CSS comment. -->
