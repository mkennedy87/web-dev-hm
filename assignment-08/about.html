        <p>I LOVE CARTOONS! I have been drawing since I could hold a pencil, and some of my earliest memories were of watching and drawing looney tunes. What I really have a passion for, right now, is animation, but that was way too complicated for this assignment. The actual reason I decided to start taking classes at UM is because they offer a couple of animation classes. I hope to one day have a career in drawing cartoons, whether that be in animating, storyboarding, or just drawing comics</p>
