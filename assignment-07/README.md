1. Divs are for grouping, Classes are for styling, ids are for identifying, and spans are for sectioning.
2. Alt text is a description of the media and the reason this is needed to be included is just in case the media doesn't load, or if the user is visually impared. This helps the user know what is supposed to be there and also helps with searching.
3. I ended budgeting my time poorly and this assignment eneded up being late, and because it was late I became overwhelmed and kept putting the assignment off, now it is really late. That said, I made sure to read everything closely and gleam as much info as possible from the reading material. After that I just kept following the steps laid out in the assignment. When it came to placing the self hosted videos in I had a problem. I reread the code a dozen times, kept going over the reading material, and even watched part of the walkthrough provided. In the end I just forgot to add the scr attribute after the source element.
