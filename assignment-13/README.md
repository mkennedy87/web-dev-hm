Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

  This assignment, no. Over the entire course, yes. I got a much better understanding of cloning repositories.

Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

  This assignment helped me learn a little more about the difference between margins and padding

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  I used the last assignment (assignment 12) as a template for this assignment and just built from there. I was trying to make a website for my art. I was having a big problem with keeping all the content below the menu but it kept loading with the top behind it. Eventually I found out that using padding instead of margin was able to bring all the content down so it was viewable. I did struggle with getting the title to interact with the logo. I wanted it to appear on the same line with the logo, but I never did figure that out. The rest of the site was populated with content I've created over the years.
